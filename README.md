# Silvus WiFi

Silvus WiFi is a project aimed at enabling Silvus radios to operate over WiFi in addition to their native RF links. This is accomplished using a combination of Layer 2 networking and VPN tunneling via N2N.

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview
Silvus radios primarily operate on Layer 2 frames, which makes bridging them over standard WiFi networks a complex task. Fortunately, Silvus devices support N2N VPN, which we leverage to tunnel traffic over WiFi networks while maintaining seamless communication.

## üì∂ Network Topology
```arduino
Silvus Radio ‚áÑ Raspberry Pi ‚áÑ WiFi ‚áÑ N2N VPN Server
```
Each Raspberry Pi (RPI) acts as a lightweight router that:

* Forwards and masquerades Layer 2+ traffic from the Silvus radio
* Establishes a secure N2N VPN tunnel
* Provides basic IP routing over WiFi networks

## üì∫ IP Camera Streaming
In addition to handling Silvus traffic, each RPI instance also:

Forwards port 8554 to 172.20.10.1:554, enabling RTSP streams from IP cameras over the VPN.

## üåê Network Configuration
* The Raspberry Pi obtains its IP address via DHCP
* mDNS is used for local hostname resolution using the format:

```bash
rpi<number>.local
```

For example, an RPI with index 3 can be accessed as rpi3.local on the local network.

## Install
### Client

```
scp -r wifi_bridge_rpi_5 admin@rpi0.local:/home/admin/Desktop
sudo sh run.sh
```

## Wifi Mesh

## IP table
| Device            | IP                 | Detail                               |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| RPI LAN interface | 172.20.0.1      | Internal, not exposed to the network |
| RPI N2N Master Node | 192.168.50.201      | Exposed to the entire network |
| CAM               | 172.20.10.x | Exposed to the entire network, needs to be reserved in the Deco DHCP server        |
| Silvus            | 172.20.x.x | Exposed to the entire network        |
